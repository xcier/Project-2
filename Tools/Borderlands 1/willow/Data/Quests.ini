[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_ClaptrapRescueLanceBunker]
MissionName=Claptrap Rescue: Crimson Fastness
MissionDescription=You've discovered another defunct Claptrap robot. Could there be an unused repair kit somewhere out here?
TurnInDescription=Thank you kindly, stranger! The Crimson Lance have no tolerance for perfectly innocent robots, such as yours truly, who wander into other people's bunkers and then get lost through no fault of their own. Here's a small gift to show my undying gratitude.
MissionSummary=Find a repair kit and return to the Claptrap robot.
MissionGiver=Claptrap
Objectives[0]=Repair Kit:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_ClaptrapRescueSanctuary]
MissionName=Claptrap Rescue: The Salt Flats
MissionDescription=You've discovered another defunct Claptrap robot. Could there be an unused repair kit somewhere out in this desolate place?
TurnInDescription=It was horrible! I don't know what happened, exactly, but I was caught in the crossfire! You definitely want to have the best possible gear if you're going to venture into this battleground. Here, you might find this useful.
MissionSummary=Find a repair kit and return to the Claptrap robot.
MissionGiver=Claptrap
Objectives[0]=Repair Kit:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_FindEcho]
MissionName=Find the ECHO Command Console
MissionDescription=It's probably impossible to take back the Vault Key or open the Vault now. Let's focus on something else instead. Let's bring the ECHO system back on-line. The Lance locked it down, but I know how we can bring it back, since I pretty much invented it. I wrote some instructions on the back of this paper towel. Find the ECHO command console, and follow my instructions.
TurnInDescription=This appears to be the ECHO command console that Tannis described. If you manage to read her rambling scrawl, you should be able to reactivate the system.
MissionSummary=Find the ECHO command console.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=ECHO console found:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_FindSteele]
MissionName=Find Steele
MissionDescription=I know where the Vault is, and so does Steele. She took my Vault Key. You know, the one you worked so hard to get for me? Well, she took it. That albino bitch is going to open the Vault unless you can somehow find her and beat her to it. I'm marking a waypoint at the location of the Vault. I don't have to tell you what to do, do I?
TurnInDescription=You've fallen into an ambush set by the Crimson Lance. Steele anticipated your pursuit and took measures to ensure you couldn't interfere.
MissionSummary=Find Steele and take back the Vault Key.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Steele found:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_FindTheVault]
MissionName=Destroy The Destroyer
MissionDescription=Do you feel that I betrayed you? Do not. I am possessed of a sight that allows me to look forward and backward along the timeline, and the release of this creature was inevitable. There was only one chance for this dimension's continued existence. A hero. Someone who was at the right place, at the right time, and strong enough to push back. I have given you the unique opportunity to defend the existence of all that you know. Go! Fight! Be that hero! I will help you however I can.
TurnInDescription=You did it! You won. I'm sorry I couldn't warn you, but for you to be here, it couldn't have unfolded any other way. You were brilliant, and your actions will not go unrewarded.
MissionSummary=Defeat the Destroyer.
MissionGiver=Guardian Angel
Objectives[0]=Destroyer defeated:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_ReactivateEcho]
MissionName=Reactivate the ECHO Comm System
MissionDescription=The notes Tannis gave you are rambling and disjointed, and appear to be written in the form of an argument with either an invisible cellmate or a rat. However, she also mentions reactivating three network transmitter consoles in three separate buildings, then returning to this main control console.
TurnInDescription=Success! The ECHO communication network is back on-line.
MissionSummary=Reactivate Transmitter Consoles.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Transmitter Console activated:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_RecoverLostData_3]
MissionName=Hidden Journal: Rust Commons East
MissionDescription=This is Patricia Tannis, calling for anyone with two brain cells to rub together. I hid five of my Data Recorders in Rust Commons East, but now I've decided I want them back. Listen to each one, and your ECHO device will record them. Once you have all five recordings, upload them to the bounty board.
TurnInDescription=Thank you for returning my journal recordings. I know that you listened to them, so now I ask that you apply blunt force trauma to your head until you forget what you heard. Those journals are private and personal.
MissionSummary=Download 5 Log Entries from Data Recorders in Rust Commons East.
MissionGiver=Middle Of Nowhere Bounty Board

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_ReturnKey]
MissionName=Bring The Vault Key To Tannis
MissionDescription=The Vault Key won't work again for another two hundred years, so it is now effectively useless. Tannis has volunteered to become the caretaker of the key, and may even pay well for it.
TurnInDescription=Thank you for bringing this to me. This cash sum should cover the hardships you've endured, and ensure your continued silence. The key won't work again for hundreds of years, but I must keep it from falling into the wrong hands. In the meantime, I will continue my research. It appears that there is more to be learned from the Eridians than weaponry and spaceships.
MissionSummary=Grab the Vault Key and return to Tannis at her Rust Commons dig site.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Vault Key:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_SpeakToTannis]
MissionName=Talk to Tannis
MissionDescription=You continue to be adequate. I can tell the ECHO system is back online because you can hear me, and I can hear you. But, even though we can hear each other, I want you to come back here and talk to me in person. I need to tinker with your ECHO device a bit.
TurnInDescription=Those useless Lance don't realize I'm helping you. If they had any sense, they'd have killed all of us long ago. That Steele woman is too intent on opening the Vault, though. Her ambition will be the death of her. Well, if you don't kill her first. You like killing people, right?
MissionSummary=Talk to Tannis inside the Crimson Fastness.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Tannis talked to:

[Z2_Missions.Missions.M_unknown]
MissionName=Get Some Answers
MissionDescription=Tannis has betrayed you. Who knows what motivates that babbling bitch, but it's a sure bet she's fled her dig site. It's time to take back your Vault key and get some answers. First, you'll need to figure out where she's hiding.
TurnInDescription=I see you either received my message or came here on some other errand. The Lance locked me in here and shut down the ECHO, but they left my communicator with me. That was really stupid of them. You probably hate me, but I didn't intend to betray you. Steele wanted the key and wanted you gone. Sending you after Baron Flynt was her idea, and it seemed like something you'd enjoy, so I went along with it. Now I'm trapped here, and she's taken the Vault Key.
MissionSummary=Find Tannis, wherever she may be.
MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Tannis found:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_ABugProblem]
MissionName=A Bug Problem
MissionDescription=Given the plant growth I've observed outside of New Haven, I suspect there is a component in the sulfur springs which acts as fertilizer for Pandora's native flora. To test my theory, I need samples both from The Retching Seeps and The Fetid Cauldron. I'd do it myself, but each location is guarded by a nasty spiderant! Eliminate these nuisances, and I'll be able to conduct further tests without the need for assistance.
TurnInDescription=Excellent work! I will begin testing these samples right away. Perhaps this study will eventually lead to profitable agriculture on Pandora! Here is your reward for helping an old chemist with his bug problem.
MissionSummary=Collect sulphur samples and kill Helob and Widowmaker.

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_AltarEgo]
MissionName=Altar Ego: Burning Heresy
MissionDescription=We need to put an end to this new 'religion' the bandits are creating, before they gain a following and all hell breaks loose. I can't help but wonder what started the whole thing, but I'm paying you to end it. I want you to destroy the scriptures that they preach at each of their altars.
TurnInDescription=I should've known, we've only made them angrier and more zealous. Fortunately, I've got new information that'll put an end to these charlatans.
MissionSummary=Burn the scriptures at bandit chapels.
MissionGiver=Middle Of Nowhere Bounty Board
Objectives[0]=1st scripture burnt:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_AnotherLittleSuprise]
MissionName=Another Piece Of The Puzzle
MissionDescription=The Guardian Angel spoke cryptically of a challenge that awaits in the Trash Coast, and Tannis thinks another piece of the Vault Key can be found there. Given the way things have worked out so far, you're probably going to need to overcome this mysterious challenge before you'll be able to obtain the third fragment of the Vault Key and return it to Tannis.
TurnInDescription=This is the third piece of the Vault Key that you've brought me. We almost have the complete set now.
MissionSummary=Recover another Vault Key Piece from the Trash Coast.

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_AssassinateJack]
MissionName=Jack's Other Eye
MissionDescription=What did you and Marcus do?  One-Eyed Jack is madder than hell, and my sources tell me he's going to take it out on New Haven.  Our only chance is to kill him before he strikes.  This is your fault.  You fix it.
TurnInDescription=That's Jack's eye, alright. I know I was upset with you, but you have taken responsiblity for your actions and fixed the situation.  Thank you.
MissionSummary=Kill One-Eyed Jack, and bring back his eye as proof.
MissionGiver=Helena Pierce
Objectives[0]=Jack's Other Eye:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_BaitResearch]
MissionName=Bait And Switch
MissionDescription=Attempts at human habitation along the Trash Coast have always failed, because spiderants overwhelm anyone who tries to live there. The bandits managed it, though, by placing a Queen Spiderant Abdomen in the middle of their camp. I want you to take an abdomen from a rival Queen, then replace the bandits' with that one. Let's see if the spiderants will do our dirty work for us.
TurnInDescription=Wow! That was even more successful than I'd hoped! I don't know if that's an easier way to keep the bandits under control, but it's sure as hell more fun! Here's your reward for a job well done.
MissionSummary=Collect a Queen Spiderant Abdomen and swap it for the bandits'.

MissionName=Bandit Treasure: Three Corpses, Three Keys
MissionDescription=One of the bandits is breathing his last few, ragged breaths. He opens his hand, holding what appears to be a strongbox key. He wheezes, 'Find brothers... two more... keys... Lance get nothin' He coughs and then lies still.
TurnInDescription=The three keys open the strongbox. Inside, you find some sort of map. The map marks a location in the Dahl Headland. Perhaps something is hidden there?

MissionName=Bandit Treasure: X Marks The Spot
MissionDescription=The ragged map in the strongbox marks a location in the Dahl Headland. The bandit's dying wish was that his treasure not fall into the hands of the Crimson Lance. You feel duty-bound to grant the man's final request by taking it for yourself.
TurnInDescription=You've discovered a strongbox like the one in Old Haven. It opens using the same three keys. Inside are various personal mementos from the brothers' childhood, which should fetch a decent price in New Haven. There is also a kick-ass gun.
MissionSummary=Go to the Dahl Headland and recover the bandit treasure.

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_BridgesDamnTrespassers]
MissionName=Get Off My Lawn!
MissionDescription=You want a favor from me? Well, pick my nose and I'll pick yours, as the saying goes. I got trespassers crawlin' all over my property here. They got their eye on my treasure. You get out there and start exterminatin' interlopers. Then we'll see about whatever it was you wanted.
TurnInDescription=What the hell do you want?! You better not be taking any of my stuff. You killed all the trespassers? I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't see any trespassers.

They brew a mean moonshine out there. Don't know what's in it, but who cares? Those bandits don't part with it willingly, of course. That's why you're going, and not me!
TurnInDescription=Thanks for the booze! Now, about that alien whatever-the-hell. Funny story. Krom heard about it and stopped by about a year ago. Gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. Why do you think I barricaded myself in here? I don't know why he wanted it, but I wasn't about to argue. That's the last I saw of it.

MissionDescription=You've discovered a defunct Claptrap here. It looks like the bandits were pretty rough on him. Perhaps there is a repair kit nearby?
TurnInDescription=Thank you most effusively for you kindness and generosity! I am not worthy to lick your boots. Not that I have a tongue. Anyway, I have this trifling trinket, which you may find useful in your travels.

MissionDescription=You've discovered another defunct Claptrap robot. Could there be an unused repair kit somewhere in this town?
TurnInDescription=Funny, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does. I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed. A guy finally gets a break from all the shooting and raping. Oh yes, these are desperate men. Just when he's having a rest, you come along and repair him. I suppose you want a reward for exposing me to more of this torturous existence.

MissionDescription=Those bandit assholes stole my C-Charges! The explosives must be around their camp somewhere. You're gonna teach them a lesson. They want my C-Charges? Fine. We'll shove 'em up their asses and set 'em off. You steal Earl's stuff, you get blasted to hell.
TurnInDescription=Hah! Taught those bandits a lesson for sure! Looks like you got a little singed, yourself. Oh, that's right! I had those charges and timers set for remote detonation! I could've done it from here, with the push of a button, but I totally forgot! That's friggin' hilarious!

TurnInDescription=Skrappy! You came home! Who's a good boy? Skrappy's a good boy! Did those mean bandits scare you? Thanks for setting him free. He's really a lap skag, and those bandits wouldn't even know how to clean up his little Skrappy-doos. Would they. No, they wouldn't!
MissionSummary=Rescue Earl's best friend, held by the bandits on the Trash Coast.
MissionGiver=Crazy Earl
Objectives[0]=Earl's best friend freed:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_FinalArtifact]
MissionName=The Final Piece
MissionDescription=The little Claptrap doorman is freed, so you should now be able to enter the Salt Flats. Talk to the Claptrap once he's at the gate. It is time to go after Baron Flynt, who punched my dog and stole a piece of the Vault Key. Did I mention he lives on a giant digging machine in the Salt Flats? He calls himself the leader of all the bandits. You'd like him, I think.
TurnInDescription=Tannis lied. Baron Flynt did not have a piece of the Vault Key.
MissionSummary=Take back the final piece of the Vault Key from Baron Flynt.

Anyway, he has a piece of the Vault key, along with most of my underwear. The details of that transaction are unimportant, just get that artifact back.
TurnInDescription=Oh, so now that Tannis bitch wants that alien hunk o' junk, eh? And you're her little helper? Bah! And they call ME 'crazy'! What have you done for me, besides blow a hole in my back fence?! Tell me that!

MissionGiver=Patricia Tannis
Objectives[0]=Path cleared:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_FirepowerMunitions]
MissionName=Firepower: Market Correction
MissionDescription=I believe that One-Eyed Jack is storing a recent ammo shipment in his warehouse. We can't have that! When there's too much supply, there's no demand. Prices go down, and nobody profits. So, I want you to go to the warehouse and trigger a little 'market correction' by destroying the ammo dumps. You'll need explosives or elemental weapons, which are, of course, available at any of my stores for a reasonable price!
TurnInDescription=You destroyed the ammo dumps! Good work, my friend! You're proving to be an extremly effective partner, and I'm so glad you weren't blasted into soup! Now, if only we knew exactly which corporation has decided to cut me out of my profits!
MissionSummary=Destroy the ammo dumps.
MissionGiver=Marcus Kincaid
Objectives[0]=Ammo Dumps destroyed:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_FirepowerPlans]
MissionName=Firepower: All Sales Are Final
MissionDescription=I have an amazing opportunity for you, my friend, where both of us stand to profit. You see, the bandits are better equipped than most of the locals! They are a large, untapped market, but they have no demand for my goods! I need someone like you to find out who is supplying them. Go to their hideout and search for a sales invoice or something. I'll pay you a fair price for the information.
TurnInDescription=As I suspected, One-Eyed Jack and his men have been receiving weapon shipments. This invoice is encoded, but it looks like one of the manufacturers decided to cut out the middle man and sell direct. I'm that middle man, and I won't tolerate it! Those faceless corporations don't care about the work I do to scratch out a living here. We must stop them somehow!
MissionSummary=Search for information about the bandit weapon supplier.
MissionGiver=Marcus Kincaid
Objectives[0]=Weapon Shipment Invoice:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_FirepowerWeapons]
MissionName=Firepower: Plight Of The Middle Man
MissionDescription=I need to know who exactly is supplying the bandits. The invoice you found was a good start, but we need more. I'm sure you can find some of the original shipping crates, and that will provide the evidence we need. While you're at it, destroy One-Eyed Jack's weapon caches. There is too much of my competitor's product out there! We'll show them what happens when they try to cut out the middle man!
TurnInDescription=So, it was Torgue who was delivering weapons to Pandora behind my back! I'll be sure to give them a stern talking-to about about their business practices.  As for the bandits, hopefully they know to buy from me from now on. Thank you, my friend! It's been a pleasure doing business with you!
MissionSummary=Destroy Weapon Caches and find evidence.

MissionName=Corrosive Crystal Harvest
MissionDescription=Corrosive Elemental Artifacts allow you to customize your skills with the power of acid. The key component for such an artifact is the Corrosive Crystal. I can fashion an artifact for you, but you'll need to provide the crystals. Go to the Tetanus Warren and shoot the Crystal Clusters to break them apart. Watch out for the bandits that have taken over the cave.

MissionSummary=Harvest Corrosive Crystals in the Tetanus Warren.
MissionGiver=New Haven Bounty Board
Objectives[0]=Corrosive Crystals:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_GreenThumb]
MissionName=Green Thumb
MissionDescription=The flowers around here may look pretty, but they're actually a pretty destructive force, and they grow just about anywhere there's water. So, you can probably understand why a broken water pipe is such a problem. Please fix it, before the flowers run me out of my home! Find a valve somewhere, then use it to turn off the water pump.
TurnInDescription=Those flowers will die off in no time. Thanks for helping out. I was never much of a plumber.

MissionName=I've Got A Sinking Feeling...
MissionDescription=The bandits have a new weapon. They've built three gunboats, and they're using them to stage raids along the entire coastline. It's got to stop. I'm putting up a bounty for anyone who'll go to Treacher's Landing and sink those things.
TurnInDescription=Great, that should put an end to the coastline raids. Those bandits are resourceful bastards, aren't they? Turn your back for a second and they'll think of some other new way to kill you.
MissionSummary=Sink the Righteous Man, Great Vengeance, and Furious Anger.

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_HeathensGodlessMonsters]
MissionName=Altar Ego: Godless Monsters
MissionDescription=After looking at those pamphlets you collected, I'm fairly certain there's something interesting out there. Their crude drawings show stick figures gathered around some kind of monster named 'Slither'. Maybe if you kill their 'god', they'll abandon this whole religious scheme?
TurnInDescription=This so-called 'Slither' is dead, so hopefully all of this bandit zealotry will die down. Thank you for helping in this matter.
MissionSummary=Go to the Trashy Knoll, find Slither, and kill it.
MissionGiver=Middle Of Nowhere Bounty Board

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_HeathensInvestigate]
MissionName=Altar Ego: The New Religion
MissionDescription=You know Old Lynne Abbey, up on the Overlook? That place has been abandoned since we pulled out of Old Haven, but some bandits recently took the place over, and are now proselytizing and handing out pamphlets to anyone who'll listen. I doubt those nut jobs have really found religion. We need to grab some of those pamplets and find out what they're up to.
TurnInDescription=Judging by the chicken scratches on the pamphlets, these bandits are about as literate as three-year-olds. Nevertheless, they are total zealots. Something's going on, and we need to take action before they gain a following.

MissionName=Jaynistown: A Brother's Love
MissionDescription=My brother Jaynis is the leader of Jaynistown, and he's turned the place into a hive of scum and villainy. It wasn't always that way. Good people used to live in that town, but his thugs chased them all away. When I protested, he exiled me, his own brother! It ain't right, and the people of that town deserve better. Jaynis needs to be 'removed' from office. Violently.
TurnInDescription=Thank you. You understand why a man can't kill his own brother. But, bounty hunters are another matter. At any rate, this is the beginning of a new era! Soon Jaynistown will be known as Taylortown!
MissionSummary=Kill Jaynis Kobb in Jaynistown
MissionGiver=Taylor Kobb
Objectives[0]=Jaynis Kobb killed:

[Z1_Missions.Missions.M_JaynisCleaningUp]
MissionName=Jaynistown: Cleaning Up Your Mess
MissionDescription=An idiot Vault Hunter follows the direction of an insane archeologist, and the result is disaster. Jaynis was no angel, but under Taylor's rule, Jaynistown is a greater threat than ever. You caused this mess, so you can clean it up by killing Taylor Kobb. If reaching the Trash Coast is so blasted important, his hacked Claptrap should allow you to pass once he's dead.
TurnInDescription=With Taylor Kobb dead, his hacked Claptrap should have reverted to his original programming. He should be willing to open the passage to the Trash Coast now.
MissionSummary=Kill Taylor Kobb, then talk to his Claptrap.

MissionName=Jaynistown: Secret Rendezvous
MissionDescription=I'm reading traces of Eridian artifact activity out at the Trash Coast, so we're going there next. It's across the drawbridges, so talk to one of the Claptraps there. Pierce has already given you the necessary credentials. It's a little shady, but I've arranged for a meeting with a bandit named Taylor Kobb. The bandits of Jaynistown control access to the Trash Coast, but he says he can get us in.
TurnInDescription=I heard you want to get into the Trash Coast. I can get you in there, but you're gonna do a favor for me, first. I've got a special job, one that I'd like to keep on the down-low, if you know what I mean. It'd be best for everyone if Helena Pierce never hears about this.

MissionDescription=You've removed my brother from power. The next step is to gather my supporters. My right-hand man is a fellow named Erik Franks. You'll find him in New Haven, keeping an eye on that Pierce bitch. Report to him, and he'll spread the word. Once we've gotten the word out, we'll clean the remaining trash out of Jaynistown. I mean, Taylortown!

As if that weren't dangerous enough, one of the biggest threats to New Haven makes his home there. King Wee Wee is angry, drunken, and surrounded by a legion of followers.

MissionName=Middle Of Nowhere No More: Fuses? Really?
MissionDescription=The bounty board is missing a fuse, of all things.  Who uses fuses these days, anyhow?  That's the problem, really. They're hard to come by, seeing as most people have thrown 'em all out.  Not like Marcus sells 'em; can't kill anyone with one.  Even if you find one, it probably won't work.  If you find three, there ought to be one in the bunch that will work.  I'd sure appreciate it if you could find some and bring 'em to me.
TurnInDescription=Nice going.  These aren't easy to find.  I'll have a look and see if any of them are still good.

If you were to get the board working again, you might find several jobs left over from before the malfunction.

In her rage, she took something of great value to me and threw it away. Go check the dumpsters outside of town. I think you'll know what you're looking for when you find it. I know it's asking a lot, but keep this just between you and me, okay? I'll make it worth your while.
TurnInDescription=Thanks, man! I'm trusting you to keep this under your hat, right? Here, I'll pay you well to keep this a secret. Don't worry that the money's a little damp, I just washed my hands.

Before I lift one finger to help you on your mad quest for the Vault, you're going to do something for me. The last electrical storm blew out New Haven's power grid. Scooter tells me the equipment is fixed now, but someone needs to go reactivate all the generators. That's where you come in.

MissionName=Smoke Signals: Investigate Old Haven
MissionDescription=Now that the bridges are open, we've noticed four columns of smoke rising from Old Haven. We believe these are bandit distress calls, since they don't have free access to ECHOnet. It could be a trap, but we can't risk ignoring a problem that's worse than the bandits themselves. I'm offering a reward to anyone who will scout Old Haven and find out what's going on.
TurnInDescription=The smoke columns were, in fact, distress calls. The Crimson Lance have routed every bandit in Old Haven, and are now using the signal to lure more bandits into their trap. Unfortunately, they make no distinction between you and the bandits!

MissionDescription=Steele has made good on her earlier threats. The Crimson Lance now consider you as much an enemy as any bandit. If they're going to be killing indiscriminately, you need to defuse their little trap before New Haven residents get hurt. Fight your way through Old Haven and put out their smoke signals. I'll reward you well once the job is done.
TurnInDescription=Thank you, here's the reward I promised. By the way, I contacted Steele. Without mentioning your name, I told her there was an attack on 'New Haven residents.' She tells me her men were acting on their own. My ass. I know she wants to turn New Haven into another Lance fiefdom, just like Sanctuary. We'll see about that.

He lives on a giant digging machine in the Salt Flats. Wait. The gate to the Salt Flats won't open unless you find the silly little Claptrap doorman. My sources tell me he's trapped inside Old Haven, so maybe you'd better go and get him out of there, first. Otherwise, I'll be stuck here with you.
TurnInDescription=Thank you, stranger! I would sing a song about your heroism, but I'm pretty sure the Crimson Lance would hear me and kill us both. They really hate music. So, I'll just see you later at the gate to the Salt Flats! Bye now!

They both live here in New Haven, but they haven't been home or responded to my calls for weeks. Jed was a troubled young man and I think he may have run away again. Shawn must've gone after him, and now I'm fearing the worst. Anyone, please, search around New Haven and find out what happened to my cousin.
TurnInDescription=This corpse matches the description of Shawn Stokely. The word 'Reaver' was carved into his forehead with a knife. The man died clutching a note in his hand.

Recently, bandits have taken up residence around the beacon stations, shutting them down in the process. Somebody needs to get out there and clean the bandit infestation out of those stations, and reactivate the beacons.
TurnInDescription=Here's your payment for services rendered. Now that those beacons are active again, hopefully somebody other than Atlas Corp. can access the interplanetary communications network. Getting back in touch with the neighboring systems should do wonders for the local economy.

TurnInDescription=Incredible! With your brain, and all the hurdles that implies, you have correctly identified a piece of the Vault Key. I want you to leave this with me, so that I may run some tests. I had one of these, once. Now, it is in the hands of Crazy Earl, along with many of my unmentionables. Do you like bugs?

Only problem is, Krom likes it, too, and he hijacked my entire supply! Make yourself useful! Go on out to Krom's Canyon and hijack it back.

If you get it back from him, you and that Tannis woman do whatever you want with it. I'm done with it.

MissionDescription=Fish are a rarity in the sludge you find around the Rust Commons, but they're out there and I'm willing to pay for them. There's no bait, lures, or nets that can catch the bastards, though. Your best bet is to go to the docks at Treacher's Landing and drop a grenade into the water.

TurnInDescription=Some of the locals heard you opened that barricade and hightailed it for New Haven. I wish them the best of luck, but the area is still crawlin' with bandits.

TurnInDescription=That ought to do it. Remember that shields aren't invincible. Damage weakens them, and once they're used up, you'll start getting hurt again. If you can avoid taking damage for a few seconds, the shield will recharge back to full power. Anyway, I've decided you're ready to start looking for Nine-Toes.

[Z0_Missions.Missions.M_FixHealthVending]
MissionName=Fix'er Upper
MissionDescription=If you're gonna head out of town, you need a shield. A shield forms an invisible barrier around you that absorbs damage. Normally, you'd buy one from the med vendor here, but this one took a bullet during the bandit raid. Fortunately, it just needs a new Power Coupling, and it so happens there's an old vendor we can use for parts. It's right outside of town, down the road east. Go grab the part, install it into the med vendor, and buy yourself a shield.
TurnInDescription=See? You don't need a PhD to do my job. I guess people just feel more comfortable with my honest face and bedside manner. Feel free to sell your items at the med vendor and buy some First Aid Kits for later.

MissionName=Bone Head's Theft
MissionDescription=Damned if the Catch-A-Ride station ain't totally busted. Diagnostics report the primary Digistruct Module is missing. Without it, that station won't do diddly. I'd hit up Bone Head and his gang. They got a camp just down the road a bit, tucked away next to Fyrestone. I bet those sons of bitches took it. Get the Digistruct Module back from them and reinstall it into this station.
TurnInDescription=See? It drops right in there. Any monkey can do it. Listen, thanks for savin' me all that trouble. I'm gonna set you up with an all-access Runner account. It'll keep you in a vehicle until my gratitude wears thin.

MissionName=By The Seeds Of Your Pants
MissionDescription=I'll only survive the winter if I can plant my crops soon enough, but I'm out of Bladeflower Seeds. I haven't been able to restock since I closed up Skag Gully. I used to get my seeds from the caves in there while I was hunting skag. Their vomit must make for amazing fertilizer.  Blasted smelly piss mongers apparently are good for something. If you're willing to risk your life and personal hygiene to give a blind man a hand, I'll reward you.
TurnInDescription=I can't believe you waded through skag infested, vomit encrusted caves just so I won't starve in the coming season. That's right neighborly of you, and I want you to have this. Even better, come back in a few months, and I'll cook you some of my famous Bladeflower Stew!

I had another go after Dr. Zed whipped up a replacement leg, but Scar got that one, too! Pulled the thing clean off, and I was barely able to drag myself home. Say, you mind getting my leg back from Scar?  If you kill him while you're at it, I got a special gift for you!
TurnInDescription=Well I'll be the demon spawn of rakk's second cousin!  That's my old leg, all right. Whoo-ee! Didn't account for the stench, but I think I can make it work. Scar got what he deserved? Great! I surely appreciate you bringing this back to me. Thank you kindly.

I wanna know if you can handle yourself in a fight against some of these beasts, so head on out there and kill some of 'em for me. If you're still in one piece, then c'mon back.

As Dr. Zed put it, nobody wants another bandit to find it and start another blood-fuelled crusade for the Vault. If you manage to come out of this fight alive, head on back to Zed and let him know what happened.

If there's any way to get inside, Shep Sanders knows it. He was a foreman for Dahl until they pulled out and left him here. You'll find him near the crossroads, keeping an eye on the bandits.

Just make sure you yell a lot so's he knows where you're standin'. Anyway, he called me, but he didn't say nothin'. That coot never calls unless he's got a reason, y'know? Would you go check on him? Make sure a skag didn't eat his other leg or somethin'.
TurnInDescription=T.K.'s dead?! Man, that asshole never returned those tools he borrowed, neither! Well, thanks for checkin' on him.

'Always plan ahead,' I say! Once you're in, look for my wife's grave. It so happens that I stashed one of her favorite guns behind the grave marker. Use it to kill Nine-Toes. She would've wanted it that way.
TurnInDescription=Huh? Who's there?! Oh, it's you again. So you actually pulled it off! Nine-Toes is dead. That'll piss off his boss Sledge for sure. Oh, if only my wife were here now. If only I could remember her name. So lonely...

MissionName=Product Recall
MissionDescription=In the journal, Bruce described a scam where he gathered local plant leaves, rolled them into cigars, then sold them to bandits while claiming they were prized offworld tobacco. With the money, he'd hoped to marry his fiancee and take her away from Pandora. Apparently, his first customer immediately died of massive internal bleeding, and the bandits forced Bruce to use his own product as payback. You'd better round up these cigars before some kid gets hold of one and smokes it in a back alley. The journal mentions that Bruce's customers were primarily the bandits around Titan's End.
TurnInDescription=Bruce is dead? That idiot! We could've made a life together here, somehow. Instead, he threw it all away on a stupid scam! Oh well, it's not like there aren't plenty of available men around. I'll get by. Thank goodness you took those poisonous cigars off the market!

I need someone to get in there, finish connecting the fuses, then blow them up. Any takers?

Members of my team attempted to defend themselves, but they were failures and now the bandits have hung up their skulls like trophies. This is unsanitary and inappropriate for an archeological dig site. I will pay someone to go to Titan's End and remove their skulls from the pikes.

They tried to ransom the region's power supply, but Helena Pierce refused to negotiate. We've been running off generator power ever since. Since you're on some sort of anti-bandit crusade anyway, why not release those brakes and turn the power back on? There'll be a reward for your trouble.
TurnInDescription=The power grid's back online, such as it is. Now, I need you to go activate all the air conditioners. Just kidding!

There is a moderate monetary reward for determining the outcome of his endeavors.

MissionDescription=Patricia Tannis here.  There have always been legends of a mysterious and elusive creature out at Jakobs Cove.  Some people call him Pumpkinhead.  Pretty spooky, huh?  I just call him Bob. As a scientist with a bit of a crackpot reputation, this story captivates me.  I would love a first-hand account of the creature.  Of course, the best way to prove something like this exists - which will then vindicate a so-called 'obsession with such a frivolous pursuit' - is a body.  So while a really blurry picture or an ECHO with some unidentifiable sounds on it would be nice, a corpse would be better. It's said to roam the swamps but only comes out when people carve creepy faces into pumpkins and put candles in them.  Doesn't make sense to me, but I never was any good at cooking.
